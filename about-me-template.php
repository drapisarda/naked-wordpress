            As an information technology professional, I worked in many fields. I've been a remote customer assistant, a system administrator and web developer with both frontend end backend responsibilities.
            In the meantime, I achieved my Batchelor Degree at the Parma University (Universit√† degli Studi di Parma) in Computer Sciences, making of this an asset for ma career.
            Here are my main professional experiences and the projects I'm currently working on.

            I'm part of the development team for the functionalities of the Fazland portal. My responsibilities are to develop some of the backend functionalities and especially to grant a smooth user experience with a coherent and usable front-end layout on every possible user device. The Fazland portal uses both Symfony and Angular 5 framework. Some of the technologies I learned and I use every day are obviously HTML5, CSS3, JS (both ES5 and ES6 with Babel), and PHP, but also important tools like Webpack, SASS, GULP and database technologies like MySQL and MongoDB.
